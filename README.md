# Particle Deformation
Numerical simulation of fluid particle deformation in the flow field

We will explore the deformation of fluid particle in some flow, such as canal, 
pipe flow(tube rond, tube squre, tube L). And give the statistic law of deformation 
in these situations.

# Functions

* ParaSolver

## To do list

* Rewrite numerical_2d.py as a subclass of ParaSolver
* Perform experiment in some flow
